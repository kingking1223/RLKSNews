<p>Ghana has become the first country to receive coronavirus vaccines through the Covax vaccine-sharing initiative.A delivery of 600,000 doses of the AstraZeneca 
vaccine arrived in Accra on Wednesday. The first recipients are due to be healthcare workers. The Covax scheme aims to reduce the divide between rich countries and 
poorer nations unable to buy doses. The programme is planning to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of the year. Ghana, which has a 
population of over 30m, was chosen as the first recipient of the free vaccines after promising quick distribution and meeting the criteria set by Covax. Further 
deliveries are expected to neighbouring Ivory Coast later this week, the Covax alliance says. Vaccinations are expected to start in Ghana next week, and, as well as 
health workers, those over 60, people with underlying health conditions, and senior officials are due to be prioritised.</p>
